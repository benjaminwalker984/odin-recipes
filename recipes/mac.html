                <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish </li>
            <li>To make the macaroni: bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, approximately 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer</li>
            <li>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed</li>
            <li>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Make Bread crumb topping: melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</li>
            <li>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
