        <h1>Chef John's Sweet Potato Casserole</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Unlike many sweet potato casseroles, this one is not too sweet. It smells so amazing, with subtly sweet potatoes accentuated with maple syrup and a pistachio topping. It's a wonderful combination of taste and textures.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Sweet potatoes:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 1/2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                    <li>salt</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup buttermilk</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 pinch ground allspice</li>
                    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
                </ul>            
                <li><h3>Pistachio crust:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup chopped roasted, salted pistachios</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 2 1/2 quart baking shish with butter.</li>
            <li>Place sweet potato cubes into a large pot, cover with water, and add a large pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook until a knife is easily inserted into a sweet potato cube, about 10 minutes. Drain well. Return to the pot and mash 2 tablespoons butter into sweet potatoes.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, maple syrup, buttermilk, milk, vanilla extract, cayenne pepper, allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mash sweet potatoes into egg mixture, starting with 2 tablespoons of sweet potato mixture, until all sweet potatoes are incorporated. Transfer sweet potatoes into prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix pistachios, brown sugar, flour, and 1/4 cup melted butter together until completely mixed. Crumble topping evenly over top of sweet potatoes. Use the back of a fork to gently press pistachio mixture down onto sweet potatoes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and casserole is set, 25 to 30 minutes. If desired, place under oven's broiler for 5 minutes to give topping a little more brown color. Let rest to cool slightly before serving, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
